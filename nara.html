    <h1>National Archives and Records Administration</h1>
    <p>By Abigail Hibbs for LSC 555 Fall 2024 <br>
        <a href="http://aad.archives.gov/aad/">National Archives and Records Administration, Access of Archival Databases</a> </p>
    <h2>System Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>The National Archives and Records Administration holds many of the records for the United States.
        Their access to archival databases site is used to search the records they have in their collection.
        The site must be easy to navigate and to learn to use so that it is accessible for all levels of users.
        It must accurately represent the collection of records held that are available to the public and therefore easy to update as new records become available.
        The National Archives is representing the United States of America and should be professional.
        It of course should have a search feature, as well as browsing options.
    </p>

    <h3>Users</h3>
    <p>This system must serve a wide variety of people from the professional researcher to the casual curious person.
    </p>

    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p> This resource provides the collection of the National Archives and Records Association that is available online.
        Within each record collection information given includes title, creator, type of material, level of description, other titles,
        the location of the collection, dates, function, scope and content, access restrictions, general notes, and basically any other information users may be interested in.
        Obviously some records have more information available than others as is the case with any archives.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>An interesting feature of the site is the ADD Tools drop down. From this menu a user can access General FAQs,
        terminology that is on the page, particularly things a casual researcher may not be familiar with, and a helpful guide to getting started.
        It also has a detailed advanced search option for many of the records which could be helpful when only limited information is known.
    </p>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to navigate, includes sitemap and breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Consistent page design throughout the site.</li>
        <li>Information is easy to find and read as everything is clearly labeled.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Page does not fit/adjust to the size of the browser.</li>
        <li>Font size of the information on the home page is a bit small.</li>
        <li>The layout and design of the page doesn't look like it has been updated since the creation</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
    <p>Overall I think this site serves its purpose successfully. They could fix the issues listed as cons but
    I don't feel as though any of them are pressing issues that must be addressed. I believe all of the important features are well done.
