    <h1>Assingment 2: System Analysis and Usability Test</h1>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>

    <h3>step 1</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Input</th>
            <th>Output</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>click download</td>
            <td>document downloads as a PDF</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>click text</td>
            <td>alternate text for the document appears when available</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>search 'war' in this collection</td>
            <td>318 results appear where 'war' is mentioned in the text</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>click next</td>
            <td>the next issue of The Tower loads</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>site critique using Nielsen's heuristics <br>
        1.Visibility of system status <br>
        the visibility is pretty good, it does give 'breadcrumbs' which is good for backtracking <br>
        2.Match between system and the real world <br>
        the menus are clearly labeled but it does not appear to have alternate language options <br>
        3.User control and freedom <br>
        with the breadcrumbs it is easy to go back to the previous page, the bar with links to home is available on every page <br>
        4.Consistency and standards <br>
        The system is very consistent, all pages have the same layout. <br>
        5.Error prevention <br>
        there are not many places to click which limits the chances of selecting the wrong thing. <br>
        6.Recognition rather than recall <br>
        the recognition is good, things are clearly labeled <br>
        7.Flexibility and efficiency of use <br>
        there are no noticable shortcuts or customization for frequent actions <br>
        8.Aesthetic and minimalist design <br>
        definitely is a minimalistic design making it easy to read and use <br>
        9.Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors <br>
        when an image doesn't load it shows a blue square with a question mark but there is nothing to do to fix that
        error when there are no results for your search are clear <br>
        10.Help and documentation <br>
        there are no options for help, FAQ, etc. but there is a contact page which you could use to reach out to the departments.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple, minimalist design</li>
        <li>Easy to navigate</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>VERY slow</li>
        <li>Search is not descriptive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The simple minimalist design meets the standards of 8 which involves aesthetic. The system is easy to navigate which meets the standards of 4 consistency and 7 efficiency. <br>
        The system is very slow which goes against 7 efficiency. The search results are not descriptive which goes against error prevention because you have to do a lot of trial and error to find the result you are looking for.

    <h2>Part 2</h2>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>comparison of part 1 and 2 results. What similarities, differences were there. Also include some suggstions.
        The system being very slow was the main thing noticed in part 1 and 2. A small experiment proved that it did not matter what browser you used, or computer you were on, it was equally as slow no matter what.
        Another similarity was the lack of information in the search results. It is difficult to select which result would best match your search when there is no context given. This would be particularly difficult if you were searching for anything that gives a lot of results.
        The option to narrow down the results helps, but when you filter the results it removes the 'this collection only' filter which is very annoying. It would be very helpful if there were more options to narrow your search, and if the results could show you what context the word is used in. 
        When searching for information about World War II and Vietnam, it was much easier to some results because there are distinct date ranges that would be relevant for this search. You know that you aren't going to be looking in the issues from 1925 for articles about World War II because it hasn't happened yet.
        As the Catholic University Archives switches over to JSTOR Forum as host for our digital collections, we hope that the user experience will be easier and the program will be faster since that is a piece of feedback we receive often from researchers. Hopefully there will be more accessibility features available while keeping the simple, clean design that is enjoyed in Islandora.
